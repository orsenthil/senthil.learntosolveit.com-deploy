I setup `Folding@Home`_ and started contributing computing resources to `Covid-19`_ project.

For Covid-19, the `Folding@Home`_ project is trying to find out the structure of covid-19 virus as it comes in contact
with human bodies through `ACE2 receptor`_, and how an understanding of this can help build therapeutic antibiotics
or molecules that might disrupt the viral interaction.

`Folding@Home`_ hit a milestone `Exaflop`_ computing speed, which is a billion billion floating point operations per
second.

**Let's not leave any stone unturned.**
