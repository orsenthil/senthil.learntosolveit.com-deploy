My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3703660748">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />

There we Einstein's thoughts on various topics. He desired a World-Government,
powerful and in control of Nuclear Weapons. Had a balanced view of both
Socialism and Capitalism. Readily allowed his critics to address their rebuttal
and answered that.

<br /><br />

He writes <i>In memoriam</i> for fellow scientists and many other great leaders
of the world. He feels guilty for being associated with development of Atom Bomb
and urges Nations to work towards peace.

<br /><br />

He shares ample stories about the difficulties Jews have through, supports the
Uprising of Warsaw ghetto.

<br /><br />

The books reveals social and personal side of Albert Einstein.
