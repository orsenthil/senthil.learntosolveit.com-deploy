    My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2535927955">2 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
    I tried to pick up some high-level intuition on the basics of calculus with this book, but I failed. Unlike, other Manga guides on electricity, and linear algebra, I found this book not very strong on the plot and I felt it did not present the story in a cohesive manner. <br /><br />The concepts were introduced randomly, and I could not see how one built upon the previously introduced concept. <br /><br />On the positive note, it did introduce very basics of calculus well, and I am eager to pick up other books on calculus with that foundation.
