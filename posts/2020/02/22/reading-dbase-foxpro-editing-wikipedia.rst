* `Life After dBase`_

.. admonition:: Interest for Maths

   My personal self-discipline is I start at page one and do all the
   odd-numbered exercises because they have the answers. I keep all the stuff
   in a notebook. Anything less just doesn't work for me. I've done calculus
   and linear algebra and statistics and dynamics, which is engineering, and
   analytic geometry, and I'm about to start hitting differential equations
   really hard. What happened was my mother-in-law bought me a book at a swap
   meet for 50 cents, and it was "The Magic of Mathematics" or something like
   that. It was a low-level book and it got me started again. I do math as a
   backdrop. I'm kind of compulsive about building things, making things, and
   dBASE was one of those.


* `Interview with Wayne Ratliff`_

He wrote dBase

.. admonition:: I was a computer

    Wayne Ratliff: Computers themselves got me away from car design. Before I
    completed my degree, I got a job with Martin Marietta in Denver. I was a
    computer. My job title was computer. Other people have programmed
    computers, but I have been one.

.. admonition:: Databases and Natural Language Research

   I went out and bought lots of books on natural language and artificial
   intelligence. I kept getting drawn from one place to another, and I did lots
   of experiments. I hadn't researched the database as much as I did the
   natural-language aspect.

.. admonition:: self-reflection

   The way I've programmed all my life is as a toolmaker. When I compare
   myself, even ten years ago, with other programmers, I see that I was trying
   to generalize to a large extent; they were trying to write programs that
   would solve a specific need. Their programs would frequently be delivered
   much sooner than mine would be, but mine would have longer lifetimes. Once
   the specific need went away, their programs were dead, they had to be
   rewritten each time the needs changed. I always wrote in such a way that the
   program could solve a family of problems, rather than just a single one.

.. admonition:: hacker?

   Wayne Ratliff: Yes. Do you think hacker is a good word or a bad word? If you
   think it's a good word, then they're hackers. They're good people, but
   they're thinking of their job rather than the user, and you have to go a
   little beyond that. That's how dBASE got started. I was thinking of how I
   wanted to use it.

* `amb operator in lisp`_

It is a neat concept to understand. The ruby code made it clear.

* `Wikipedia Editing Quickref`_

Adding references seems easiest contribution one can make.

* `Modeling Economics using IPython by Peter Norvig`_

Am I reading this right? 99 percentile end up with all the wealth and then it get's swapped?
