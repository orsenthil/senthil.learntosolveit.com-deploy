    My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3074143623">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
    This book helped me get into Deep Learning. This is a high-level overview that any software engineer will desire as we try to understand “this new world” (even as of 2019). The terms in new-world are used in multiple Medium articles, and github.io pages and github.com READMEs, and we wonder what any of these have to do with solving the problem, how does it fit in, etc. This book took a top-down approach to explain it all and help me made sense of every article that I read about Deep Learning, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Artificial Intelligence as of 2019. I like to thank the Authors for their invaluable and accessible contribution to this field of AI and Neural Networks.
