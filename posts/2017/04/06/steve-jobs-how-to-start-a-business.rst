This is a short documentary on Steve Jobs, trying to start again with the NeXT computers. It captures him as
a individual working with his team, using his experience, build and sell a computer for education market.

Given the team he had, the approach he took, it seems that the result was a successful one.

    BYTE in 1989 listed the NeXT Computer as among the "Excellence" winners of the BYTE Awards, stating that
    it "shows what can be done when a personal computer is designed as a system, and not a collection of
    hardware elements". Citing as "truly innovative" the optical drive, DSP, and object-oriented programming
    environment, the magazine concluded that "the NeXT Computer is worth every penny of its $6500 market price".
