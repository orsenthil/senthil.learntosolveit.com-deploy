    by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4949703.William_E_Shotts_Jr_">William E. Shotts Jr.</a><br/>

    My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2226561998">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />

    For most purposes, I think this could be considered a reference book. Giving quick tips about the
    Linux/GNU utility and tools. Even as an experienced user, I managed to find useful tips in this book
    about Bash Shell, quoting and testing conditionals in Bash. I appreciated the general notes about
    the "Linux culture" sprinkled throughout the text. <br /><br />This book might be a quick, due to
    glancing and turning of pages, and worthy read beginner and experienced programmers alike.<br />
