    by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2778055.Kurt_Vonnegut_Jr_">Kurt Vonnegut Jr.</a><br/>
    My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2224419627">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
    This book can be read in the time you'd read the wikipedia page about this book. This was the first
    Kurt Vonnegut book for me, and it was a sampler for what to expect if I read more from the author.
    It's a concise presentation of dystopian future when humanity has decided on population control in a
    weird way. I was thinking that there is logical loop hole in the book, I can't say that as it would be
    a spoiler, however, I think, author intended the reader to focus on the bigger picture than question
    some of the assumptions.<br /><br />The book might help you to appreciate the mess in this world!
