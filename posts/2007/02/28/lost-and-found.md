<html><body><p>While shifting my house from Jeevan Bhima Nagar to C.V.Raman, my roomie Marcus ha d emphasized many a times not to loose the Indane Gas Customer Receipt as that was the only proof that Marcus is the customer of Indane Gas Agency and any transfer of Gas will be possible.

As much as he insisted, I had lost it. We lost hope of finding it also.

Today morning, he called me and said that I had left it in a one old book of his given it to me. Today while he was cleaning stuff, preparing for his movement to chennai, found the lost Gas Customer Receipt by surprise! Thats a good news for me today.</p></body></html>
