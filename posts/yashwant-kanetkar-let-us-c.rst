I came across an article on `Yashwant Kanetkar`_, and it rekindled many of my fond memories.

    Let Us C is not merely a book, but a bible for millions of programmers in India.

That is true for me. I had read it during years 2000-2002, and I kept a count of it. I read, solved all the
problems in that book for more than 100 times.

It has helped me a lot and I am indebted to that book.

The `article on Yashwant Kanetkar`_ was published in a Indian magazine, I made a
copy of it, because, as you can imagine, I will cherish it.

I also watched a short talk by Yaashwant Kanetkar in which he explores his journey, and has some words of advice for
programmers from India.
