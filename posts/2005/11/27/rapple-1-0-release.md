Subject: [Rapple-devel] Rapple 1.0 Released!



I have just released rapple 1.0 via FRS onto

sourceforge.net.  This release (along with tests,

resources and website docs) has been tagged

Release-1_0.



Many thanks to all involved in meeting this deadline.

There are still places where we can improve and

features we can add but I think it is important that a

functional version is made public so that we can begin

to understand how end users see the tool.  The

progress we have made so far in quality (e.g., unit

test framework) and documentation (e.g., Doxygen and

website) is great and gives us a good basis to start

from.



I have tentatively put together a roadmap for release

1.1 (you can see this on the website now) so let's put

some ideas together for what should be done and what

we need to fix or improve on in the current

implementation!



Thanks for all your input!



Regards,

Alan.</p></body></html>
