I am a `Donald Knuth fan`_, and sometimes I strive to understand his `lectures`_. Stumbled upon this website called
webofstories.com that feature many scientists and carries *extensive* interviews with them, who reflect upon their
life, their personal moments, their personal views on their achievements.

I watched the entire `3 hour interview with Donald Knuth`_ and immensely enjoyed it.

One of the excellent moment was, when he shares his 2nd computer program, which was a learning tic-tac-toe. This was
written for the IBM 650 Machine having just 10K bytes of memory.

Those days, the programs were written in punched-cards and a typical program would look something like this (location,
instruction).

    0003 1000018003
    0004 6100080007
    0005 2400008003
    0006 0100008000
    0007 6900060005
    0008 2019990003


Imagine writing an AI program in that. The difficulty of writing does not matter, just the possibility that it could be
written and could be very was exciting, probably led Knuth to write it. This video shows his excitement when he shares
that moment.

Other interview bits are interesting too. Knuth covers academia, maths, computer science, computer history, programming
as art, typography, religion, his dates, his wife, his children and awards he has won. Many interesting things can be
picked up.
