.. type: text

A minimalist browser extension that displays a new quote in the browser tab. For example, when you open a new tab, you will see quotes like this:

----

*"And this is aviation; I give it to the world."*  - *Louis Mouillard, French Inventor/Aeronaut (1834-1897)*

*"We were on the point of abandoning our work when the book of Mouillard fell into our hands, and we continued with the results you know."* - *Wilbur Wright, American Inventor/Aviator (1867-1921)*

---- 

This extension is named after popular Unix Program `fortune <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_(Unix)>`_, a command line utility which displays quotes in the shell. The browser with tabs is a modern shell interface of the computer. And this is the fortune program for the browser.

Technical Details
-----------------

I developed this with Python hosted on Google App Engine, and the client side written using Javascript as a browser addon. In the backend there is a database where I keep the quote and author in a table. There is API call that returns the quote and the author in the JSON format. To call the API visit http://quotes-1271.appspot.com/json . This is an unauthenticated API as it read-only GET call, and cannot change the state of the system.

The client side is entirely handled by Javascript, and it displays the quote using simple `DOM <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model>`_ manipulation.
