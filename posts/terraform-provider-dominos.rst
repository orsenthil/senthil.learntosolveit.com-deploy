I ordered Pizza using `terraform`_ today. I was learning about terraform and how provider can be anything,
even Software as a Service, which is basically an API.

So, it made possible to develop software like terraform-provider-dominos_ using which you can order Pizza.
I tried it. The terraform apply crashed for me, but I knew that terraform might have attempted the purchase operation
and had probably crashed due to slow response from the API. It was the case. I saw my credit card charged in my account, an order confirmation email, and in 30 minutes, I got my pizza.
